*Click on each entry below to see bibtex and additional information on what factors affecting driver's attention have been considered, which include the following:*

**Driving task:** specific driving-related task, e.g. vehicle following, parking, take over control from automation, hazard anticipation, etc. **Inattention:** distraction, drowsiness. **Demographics:** age, gender. **Environment:** road geometry (e.g. curved), road type (e.g. rural, highway), intersection, traffic (density), road users (pedestrians, cyclists), visibility. **Automation:** presence of assistive or autonomous driving technology that controls the vehicle laterally (lane assist) or longitudinally (adaptive cruise control), or provides warnings/guidance to the driver.
